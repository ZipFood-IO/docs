This guide explains how orders work for ZIPFood Clients, from creation to completion.

## **1. Creating an Order**

**Where:**

Go to the “Order Management” section in your dashboard and click “Create new order.”

**Steps:**

- Fill in pickup and dropoff details (address, contact, time).
- Specify package details (size, weight, quantity).
- Add notification preferences (email, SMS, webhook).
- Select dispatch settings (how and when the order should be released).
- Review and submit your order.

**Tip:**

You must have a payment method on file to place an order.

## **2. Order Statuses**

Orders move through several statuses:

- **Pending:** Order is created and waiting to be assigned.
- **Assigned:** A robot/pilot has been assigned to your order.
- **Pickup Started:** The robot/pilot is on the way to pick up your package.
- **Out for Delivery:** The package is en route to the drop-off location.
- **Delivered:** The package has arrived at the destination.
- **Completed:** The order is finished and closed.
- **Rejected/Cancelled:** The order was not fulfilled (can be cancelled by you before completion).

You can view the status of each order in the Order List.

## **3. Managing Orders**

**View Details:**

Click on any order in the list to see full details, including package info, pilot/robot assigned, and live tracking (if available).

**Edit Orders:**

You can edit orders that are not yet completed or cancelled.

- Change pickup/dropoff details, package info, or notifications.
- Submit changes for updated estimates and fulfillment.

**Cancel Orders:**

You can cancel orders that are still pending or assigned.

- Use the “Cancel” action in the order menu.

## **4. Notifications**

You can set up notifications for each order:

- **Email:** Receive updates at specified email addresses.
- **SMS:** Get text alerts to your phone.
- **Webhook/URL:** Integrate with your own systems for real-time updates.

## **5. Payment, Billing & Estimated Cost**

**Payment Methods:**

- You must have a valid payment method (bank account or credit/debit card) saved in your account settings before placing an order.
- You can add, remove, or change payment methods at any time.

**Order Estimates:**

- When you submit a new order, ZIPFood will show you one or more delivery options in the Order Estimate Modal.
- Each option displays:
    - **Estimated Duration:** How long delivery will take.
    - **Estimated Cost:** The total price for that option.
- Review and select the option that best fits your needs before confirming the order.

**Billing:**

- The cost of your selected delivery option is billed to your chosen payment method when the order is placed.
- You can view the total cost, tip, and any additional charges in the order details.
- All completed orders are listed in your dashboard for reference and accounting.

**Tips:**

- The fastest delivery option may cost more.
- If you need a receipt or invoice, you can download it from the order details page.
- If your payment fails, you’ll be notified and can update your payment method to retry.

## **6. Order History & Tracking**

- All orders are listed in your dashboard.
- Use filters to search by date, status, type, provider, or location.
- Click on an order to see its history, tracking, and attachments.

## **7. Troubleshooting**

- If an order is stuck in “Pending,” check your payment method or contact support.
- For delivery issues, use the contact info in the order details.
- You can always cancel or edit orders before they are completed.
