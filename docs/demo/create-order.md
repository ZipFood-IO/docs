Click **Create New Order** to open the **New Order** page which contains these sections:

- **Pick-up Details**
  - Address information (pickup address)
  - Pick-up time window
  - Drop-off time window

- **Dispatch Settings**
  - Dispatch preferences and options

- **Drop-off Details**
  - Contact person name
  - Drop-off address information
  - Delivery instructions

- **Package Details**
  - Total value
  - Contents / description

- **Items Info**

Fill out the required sections and click **Submit Order**.

### **3. Selecting an Order Estimate**

After submitting the form, the **Order Estimates** popup appears. It shows multiple options with different **Duration** and **Price** tradeoffs.

- Review the three estimate options
- Select the one that fits your needs (faster vs cheaper)

After confirming the estimate:
